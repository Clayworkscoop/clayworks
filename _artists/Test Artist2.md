As a clay artist and with a background in interior designer, I enjoy creating hand built functional and non-functional decorative pieces and sculptural work.  I am drawn to the use of hand made stamps and carving to embellish my clay surfaces, and I use oxides, under glazes, and glaze layering to accentuate these textures.  I also enjoy making small sculptures of animals and whimsical characters. I have a special interest in Raku, and enjoy participating in Raku firings any chance I get!

I have had pieces accepted in the Ottawa Guild of Potters juried exhibitions for 2016, 2017, and 2018 and in the 2017 Fireworks Fusion Clay and Glass Bi-annual Exhibition.  I was the recipient of the Ottawa Guild Of Potters Best Expression Award in 2016.
