  title: "About the Studio"
  text-1: "Formed in June, 2003, Gladstone Clayworks is a non profit pottery cooperative studio. It is a place where members pursue their love of clay in a creative, inspiring and supportive atmosphere."
  text-2: "While developing their own work, members encourage the work of others, work safely at all times, and contribute to the ongoing needs and future stability of the co-operative by offering their time and effort when required.We are housed in what was previously an old bread factory, but is now a building increasingly dedicated to artists and artisans working in a variety of media. The studio itself is a brightly lit, warm space of 1800 square feet. It has easy ground-floor access with parking right outside the door."
